            <h1>When you think too much and hear yourself too little</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">
            A space for decisions that steal your peace and life shifts you can no longer postpone.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
            You might feel like you’re at a turning point. Carrying on as things are no longer feels right,
            but the next step isn’t clear yet.
            </p>
            <p>
            Maybe there’s one specific decision weighing on you, or simply the sense that the life you’re living
            no longer fits who you are. In both cases, what hurts is the same:
            <strong>being stuck in between</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here you’ll find two different containers, with the same intention:
            to help you return to yourself, so your choices come from an inner truth rather than external pressure.

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Decision Breakthrough Call · Clarity to Decide</strong></p>
            <p>
            A single session for decisions that are stealing your peace, big or small.
            A space to calm the noise, organise what feels confusing and find your next step from within.

            <p><strong>Returning to Yourself · Deep life transition support</strong></p>
            <p>
            An ongoing process for those who no longer recognise themselves in the life they’re living and
            want to realign work, lifestyle and presence with who they are today.

        <h2>If you recognise yourself in this</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>feeling stuck in mental loops and “what ifs”</li>
            <li>no longer feeling at home in the life you’re living</li>
            <li>afraid of making “the wrong decision” and end up paralysed</li>
            <li>want to trust what you feel again, but keep doubting yourself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            then it’s likely that something in you is already asking for change.  
            You don’t have to walk through this alone.

        <h2>Where to start</h2>
        <p>
            If there is one specific decision weighing on you right now, start with the
            <strong>Decision Breakthrough Call</strong>. Sometimes all it takes is a safe and honest space
            to hear what you already knew, but couldn’t yet fully own.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it feels like it’s no longer just about one decision, but about the way you’re living,
            <strong>Returning to Yourself</strong> might be the space for that transition — with support,
            presence and truth.
