          This is not a program to “fix one area of life”. It’s a space to reconnect with yourself as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel like you no longer recognise yourself in the life you’re living, that your choices no longer reflect who you are today, or that you’re going through an inner transition you can’t yet name, this space is for you.

      <h2>When it’s no longer just about “what should I decide?”</h2>
      <p>
        There are moments when the question is not just about a single decision, but about the feeling that your life as it is no longer matches who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you’ve changed, grown, or awakened to new parts of yourself, and suddenly your work, routine, relationships, or even where you live don’t fit in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t have to be a crisis. It can be an invitation. But it’s an invitation that can feel overwhelming when walked alone.
      </p>

      <h2>What Returning to Yourself is</h2>
      <p>
        Returning to Yourself is a 1:1 support for those in transition who want to realign their life — inside and out — with who they are now.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not a formula or a rigid method. It’s an ongoing space of presence, listening and clarification, where we bring into awareness what is already shifting and align your choices with what feels true to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work with what’s alive for you: work, lifestyle, relationships, purpose, moving countries, the way you show up in the world. The topic is not the main thing. You are.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How it can look</h2>

      <p>
        This is a deep, ongoing support for those moving through an inner transition
        and wanting to realign their life, choices and presence with who they are.
        The structure is clear, but flexible enough to honour your pace.
      </p>

      <h3>Returning to Yourself — Ongoing Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>minimum duration of 3 months</li>
        <li>2 individual sessions per month, 60 to 75 minutes each</li>
        <li>message support between sessions for integration</li>
        <li><strong>500 € per month</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Single Individual Session</h3>
      <p>
        If you prefer to experience how it feels to work with me first, you can book a single
        individual session of 60 to 75 minutes. It is a deep space where we already work directly
        with what you're moving through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>150 €</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to enter the ongoing process afterwards, the value of this session
        is deducted from your first monthly payment.
      </p>

      <p>
        What matters most is that you choose the format that brings you clarity and safety
        to follow your path.
      </p>

      <h2>This space is for you if you…</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>no longer recognise yourself in the life you’re living</li>
        <li>feel you’re in an inner transition and don’t yet know where it’s taking you</li>
        <li>want to realign work, lifestyle and presence with who you are today</li>
        <li>want to shift how you relate to your life</li>
        <li>value presence, deep listening and truth more than quick formulas</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not for you if you…</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>are looking for quick fixes and external guarantees</li>
        <li>want someone to tell you exactly what to do</li>
        <li>are not open to observing yourself honestly</li>
        <li>don’t want to commit to a process</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Next step</h2>
        <p>
            If you feel this process is for you and you're ready to move into a place of deeper
            inner alignment, there are two ways to begin.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Start the Returning to Yourself process</strong><br>
            If you already have clarity about your moment and what you need, you can begin the
            ongoing support right away. The commitment is monthly, with a minimum duration of 3 months. Inside the sessions, we move at your internal pace, without rush or fixed formulas.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Book a single individual session</strong><br>
            If you prefer to first experience what it’s like to work with me, you can start with
            a deep 60–75 minute session.  
            If you then choose to enter the ongoing process, the value of this session will be
            deducted from your first month.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you're unsure which format is the best starting point for you, send me a message
            and share what you're going through. We'll find the right entry point together.
