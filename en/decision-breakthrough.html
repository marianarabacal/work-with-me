        <p class="subtitle">Clarity to Decide</p>
        <p class="lead">
          When a decision is stuck inside you and, no matter how much you think about it, nothing becomes clearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are moments when your mind won’t stop, your body tightens, and every scenario you analyse leads nowhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all you want is one thing: <strong>clarity</strong>. Clarity to breathe better, to stop blaming yourself, to finally move forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some decisions look small but steal your peace. Others feel big and keep you in a mental spiral, questioning every possible path.
          <br /><strong>The size of the decision doesn’t matter — what matters is the impact it has on you.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          And what if there was a space where you could finally hear yourself… without noise, without pressure, without judgement?
        </p>
        <p>
          A space where someone helps you organise what feels confusing, see what’s already inside you, and reconnect with your own truth?
          That’s what happens here.

      <h2>What the Decision Breakthrough Call Is</h2>
      <p>
        It’s a moment with yourself. With inner quiet. With presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        A space where I guide you to listen to what you already know but can’t access right now. No expectations. No rush. No judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, the goal isn’t to think more. It’s to <strong>listen better</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t tell you what to do. I don’t push you in any direction. I simply help you reconnect with what is true for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        This call exists to bring <strong>clarity, direction and relief</strong> — whether the decision is small or big.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I do this work</h2>
      <p>
        For years, I made decisions based on what I “should” do, what “made sense”, or what seemed safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kept moving further away from my intuition until I couldn’t recognise myself anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when I finally started listening again, I realised something essential:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Clarity doesn’t appear when you think more. Clarity appears when you return to yourself.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why I do this work today. Because I know what it’s like to feel blocked. And I know the relief that comes when you can finally hear yourself again.
      </p>

      <h2>What happens during this call</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You calm the internal noise enough to hear yourself</li>
        <li>We organise together what feels confusing in your mind</li>
        <li>I capture what you say in between the lines and mirror it back with clarity</li>
        <li>We distinguish what is truly yours (and what isn’t)</li>
        <li>We bring light to what you were already feeling but couldn’t fully acknowledge</li>
        <li>We step out of the “what if…” loop and return to what actually matters now</li>
        <li>And by the end, your next step becomes obvious</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not magically, but because <strong>you return to yourself</strong>.
